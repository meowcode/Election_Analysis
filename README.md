# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

An audit has been done on election data from a county. The county provided data that included Ballot ID,County,Candidate. Initially, this audit only provided the total votes, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winning results. However, the election commission has requested additional information to complete the audit:

Voter turnout for each county
Percentage of votes from each county
County with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
In this election, three counties participated and a total of 369,711 votes were cast. The county with the highest turnout rate was Denver with 82.8%(306,055) of the total votes and the county with the least turnout rate was Arapahoe with 6.7%(24,801) of the total vote. 

The winner of this election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8%(271,892) of the total votes. The candidate with the least amount of votes was Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1%(11,606) of the total votes.
