# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

An audit has been done on election data from a county. The county provided data that included Ballot ID,County,Candidate. Initially, this audit only provided the total votes, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winning results. However, the election commission has requested additional information to complete the audit:

  * Voter turnout for each county
  * Percentage of votes from each county
  - County with the highest turnout
